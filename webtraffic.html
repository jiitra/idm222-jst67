            <h2 class="casestudy__header">The Ask</h2>
            <p class="casestudy__text">Before I transferred to Drexel, I was a student at Rochester Institute of
                Technology. During my fall semester, I took an Intro to Interactive Media course. This course covered a
                little bit of everything, and the coursework included copyright law, pitching concepts, and video,
                audio, and image editing.</p>
            <p class="casestudy__text">Our main assignment was to pitch a game or website idea, basing our concepts on
                demographic data and digital media trends. Web Traffic was my response to the assignment. I started by
                writing a white paper that explained the concept and my motivations for creating the idea. Then, I used
                Figma to create an interface design that summarized my paper in a website format. This was my first time
                using Figma, and this experience encouraged me to learn more about Figma afterwards.</p>
            <p class="casestudy__text">The Figma interactive prototype is a visual representation of the white paper. To
                view the white paper, see the file below.
            </p>
            <div class="iframe__container square">
                <iframe class="casestudy__iframe" src="media/jillian-tracy-white-paper.pdf"></iframe>
            </div>

            <h2 class="casestudy__header">Brand Identity & Concept</h2>
            <p class="casestudy__text">Web Traffic is an original game concept for mobile and browser enjoyment. It is a
                casual free-to-play
                endless runner game where users compete for high scores on the leaderboard. The user plays as a car, and
                the goal is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible. But, Web Traffic has a twist. There are three
                types of levels: high, medium, and low traffic. In high traffic levels, other cars are the main
                obstacles. In low traffic levels, the environment is the main obstacle. Before playing a level, the user
                can input a website URL or select popular sites from a list. Web Traffic selects a level based on how
                popular the inputted website is. Essentially, the level style is based on the inputted website’s
                popularity, or traffic. </p>

            <p class="casestudy__text">The target audience for Web Traffic is women who are casual mobile game enjoyers.
                According to a 2017
                report from Google Play, 64% of women prefer mobile gaming over other platforms, as opposed to only 38%
                of men. Since women encompass over half of the active market, this demographic should be recognized.
                Furthermore, Web Traffic is easily accessible because it is free-to-play and fast-paced.</p>

            <h2 class="casestudy__header">Visual Design</h2>

            <img class="casestudy__img-hero" src="img/webtraffic-moodboard.jpg">

            <p class="casestudy__text">My color palette was inspired by road signage and other colors prominent on the
                road. I chose an energetic color palette to convey the fast pace of gameplay. Similarly, I chose
                Variex as a decorative typeface to maintain the energy and create movement in the lettering. I chose
                Filson soft as the body text to contrast the sharpness of Variex and bring something more contemporary
                into the design.
            </p>
            <p class="casestudy__text">
                My interactive prototype is a website explaining Web Traffic, featuring the chosen color palette and
                font pairings. I prioritized strong visual hierarchy and legibility in my final design. </p>

            <h2 class="casestudy__header">takeaways</h2>
            <p class="casestudy__text">If I were to redo the prototype, I would be more mindful of information
                architecture. I would compile more data to inform my design by doing activities like card sorting, and
                eventually usability testing on the high-fidelity prototype. While the existing prototype functions as a
                representation of my white paper, the interface design could be improved by ensuring that it adheres to
                design conventions. </p>
