            <h1>Web Traffic</h1>
            <h2>The Ask</h2>
            <p>Project description , requirements, details ...</p>

            <h2>Brand Identity & Concept</h2>
            <p>Web Traffic is an original game concept for mobile and browser enjoyment. It is a casual free-to-play
                endless runner game where users compete for high scores on the leaderboard. The user plays as a car, and
                the goal is to avoid obstacles for as long as possible. But, Web Traffic has a twist. There are three
                types of levels: high, medium, and low traffic. In high traffic levels, other cars are the main
                obstacles. In low traffic levels, the environment is the main obstacle. Before playing a level, the user
                can input a website URL or select popular sites from a list. Web Traffic selects a level based on how
                popular the inputted website is. Essentially, the level style is based on the inputted website’s
                popularity, or traffic. </p>

            <p>The target audience for Web Traffic is women who are casual mobile game enjoyers. According to a 2017
                report from Google Play, 64% of women prefer mobile gaming over other platforms, as opposed to only 38%
                of men. Since women encompass over half of the active market, this demographic should be recognized.
                Furthermore, Web Traffic is easily accessible because it is free-to-play and fast-paced.</p>

            <h2>Visual Design</h2>

            <p>My color palette was inspired by road signage and other colors prominent on the road. I equally wanted to
                ensure that the color palette was energetic to convey the fast pace of gameplay. Similarly, I chose
                Variex as a decorative typeface to maintain the energy and create movement in the lettering. I chose
                Filson soft as the body text to contrast the sharpness of Variex and bring something more contemporary
                into the design.

                My interactive prototype is a website explaining Web Traffic, featuring the chosen color palette and
                font pairings. I prioritized strong visual hierarchy and legibility in my final design. </p>
